# I wrote this because sometimes I would:

* forget to fork, and would work against the master repo.
* forget to start a branch, and would accidentally work on the master branch
* forget to set my upstream origin, and would have to stop my flow and fix that
* Forget to add my project manager, and they miss out on notifications on my commits
* Run git clone in the wrong directory, and have to delete it, and reclone 

Now I just run `lambdaclone git@github.com:tfolbrecht/lambdaclone.git`

## Getting started

You must fill out the scripts variables inside quotes " with the following

| email                 | Your GitHub account email address |
| username              | Your GitHub account Username |
| secretkey             | Your [GitHub Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)|
| branch_name           | The name of the branch you create, I use firstname-lastname |
| TLuser                | Your Primary TL's Username |
| TL5user               | Your 5th Day TL's Username |
| project_parent_path   | The path to the directory you wnat to clone to |
| project_prefix        | Optional prefix text to prepend at beginning of your local & remote repository (Example: 'LambdaSchool_') |

| editor_bin            | Specify editor command |
| debug                 | Set to true to output debugging messages |

*note,* *not the most secure method of storing api keys lol*

Move/symlink script somewhere in your user execution path like `/usr/local/bin/` or `~/.local/bin`

## Todo

- ~~Check if variables empty~~
- ~~auto open editor with new repo path~~
- test against multiple configurations
- check credential validity
- support non ssh
- make github api only version (fork, add collaborator, set branch)
- best practice api key storage
- interactive ncurses menu, options, etc
